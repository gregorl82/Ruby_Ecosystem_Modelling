<h1>Ruby Ecosystem Modelling</h1>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<ul>
<li>Model a small ecosystem using Ruby</li>
<li>Ecosystem is made up of 3 parts: bears, river and fish</li>
<li>Use classes for each of these</li>
</ul>
<h3>How the ecosystem should work:</h3>
<ul>
<li>A river should have a name e.g. “Amazon”</li>
<li>A river should hold many fish</li>
<li>A fish should have a name</li>
<li>A bear should have a name e.g. “Yogi” and a type e.g. “Grizzly”</li>
<li>A bear should have an empty stomach ( maybe an array )</li>
<li>A bear should be able to take a fish from the river</li>
<li>A river should lose a fish when a bear takes a fish</li>
</ul>
<h3>Extensions:</h3>
<ul>
<li>A bear could have a roar method</li>
<li>A bear could have a food_count method</li>
<li>A river could have a fish_count method</li>
</ul>
